    <h1 class="mb-4">Welcome to Fitnas Means Results</h1>
    <p class="mb-4">
        Hello my name is Nasreen and thank you for visiting my website. I am a level 4 fitness professional registered
        with REPS the UK's leading exercise body for fitness instructors. I have worked in the health and fitness
        industry for 15 years and qualified as a Personal Trainer in 2004. Since the age of 16 I naturally had a great
        enthusiasm learning about health and fitness topics. Whist bringing up my two young children I decided to gain
        my aerobics qualification which launched my career as a freelance instructor delivering various group exercise
        programmes. I also have a dance background in ballet, jazz, tap and bollywood.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
        My Pilates qualification has gained me additional skills to help clients improve their core, posture and
        flexibility and improve their overall well -being. I get great job satisfaction helping people achieve their
        health and fitness goals.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
        My GP exercise referral and British Association Cardiac Rehab Phase IV Instructor qualifications enable me to
        deliver safe exercise programmes for individuals with diabetes, arthritis, asthma and stable heart conditions.
